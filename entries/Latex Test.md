
WLOG, assume either one, two or three of w,x,y and z are odd

$ 2|a, $  iff  $ 4|a^2$

Case 0: none of them is odd

$z^2 = (2a)^2 + (2b)^2 + (2c)^2 $

$= 4a^2 + 4b^2 + 4c^2 $

RHS is 0 mod 4, since everything else is 0 mod 4

$z^{2}$ is divisible by 4, so z is divisible by 2


Case 1: 1 of them is odd

$z^2 = (2a+1)^2 + (2b)^2 + (2c)^2 $

$= 4a^2 + 4a + 1 + 4b^2 + 4c^2 $

RHS is 1 mod 4, since everything else is 0 mod 4

$z^{2}$ isnt divisible by 4, so z isnt divisible by 2

Case 2: 2 of them are odd

$z^2 = (2a+1)^2 + (2b+1)^2 + (2c)^2 $

$= 4a^2 + 4a + 1 + 4b^2 + 4b + 1 + 4c^2 $

RHS is 2 mod 4, since everything else is 0 mod 4

$z^{2}$ isnt divisible by 4, so z isnt divisible by 2

Case 3: 3 of them are odd

$z^2 = (2a+1)^2 + (2b+1)^2 + (2c+1)^2 $

$= 4a^2 + 4a + 1 + 4b^2 + 4b + 1 + 4c^2 + 4c + 1 $

RHS is 3 mod 4, since everything else is 0 mod 4

$z^{2}$ isnt divisible by 4, so z isnt divisible by 2

Therefore, z is only even if w,x and y are even
