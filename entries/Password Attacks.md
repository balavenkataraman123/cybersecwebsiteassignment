### Password attacks

If your password is simple or common, you are at risk of a password attack, such as a brute force attack or a dictionary attack.

Brute force attacks test every possible combination of password, so short passwords can be cracked relatively easily.

Dictionary attacks are a bit more sophisticated, and try out passwords out of a list of the most commonly used passwords. If your password is in this list of , [10000 most common passwords list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:10,000_most_common_passwords), it might be at risk.
