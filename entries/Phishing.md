Phishing is a type of cyber attack that involves tricking individuals into providing sensitive information, such as passwords or financial information, by disguising as a trustworthy source. This can be done through various methods, including email, text message, or phone call.

One of the most effective ways to protect yourself from phishing attacks is to be aware of the different types of phishing and how they work. For example, email phishing often involves an attacker posing as a legitimate company or organization, and asking for personal information or login credentials. Phone phishing often involves an attacker posing as a customer service representative and asking for sensitive information.

Another important step is to be cautious when clicking on links or providing personal information. Do not click on links in unsolicited emails, and be wary of providing personal information over the phone or through a website. Before giving away any personal information, verify the authenticity of the requester by independently searching the company's contact information and not clicking on links provided in the email.

It is also important to use anti-virus and anti-phishing software, which can help to detect and block phishing attempts. These programs can also help to warn you when you visit a website that is known to be associated with phishing.

Additionally, you should enable two-factor authentication for your online accounts. This can make it much more difficult for attackers to gain access to your accounts, even if they manage to steal your password.

You can also educate yourself about the common tactics used in phishing attacks, such as creating a sense of urgency or using social engineering tactics. By being aware of these tactics, you can better recognize a phishing attempt when it occurs.
