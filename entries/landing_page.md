## Main concepts

Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting computer systems, networks, and devices from digital attacks, theft of data, and damage. 

The main components of Cybersecurity are:

- Threats: These are potential attacks or hazards that can compromise the security of a computer system, network, or device. Threats can come in many forms, such as viruses, malware, phishing scams, and hackers.

- Vulnerabilities: These are weaknesses in a computer system, network, or device that can be exploited by threats. For example, an unpatched software vulnerability might allow a hacker to gain unauthorized access to a system.

- Risk: This is the probability that a threat will exploit a vulnerability, and the potential impact on the system, network, or device if that happens.

- Controls: These are measures put in place to prevent or mitigate the risks associated with threats and vulnerabilities. Examples of controls include firewalls, antivirus software, and user authentication protocols.

- Security posture: This refers to the overall security of an organization's computer systems, networks, and devices. A strong security posture involves implementing effective controls and regularly reviewing and updating them to keep up with the evolving threat landscape.
