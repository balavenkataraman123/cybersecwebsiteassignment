I got it as a prize for first place in all of India in a math and science contest I did in grade 5. After coming to Canada, I used it in school in grades 6 and 7, before the hinge disintegrated because it had the same build quality and durability as a sheet of wet cardboard. System board is intact, so it is technically still usable.
I plan to restore it in the future as it is still really significant to me because it was the first big thing I earned myself.
