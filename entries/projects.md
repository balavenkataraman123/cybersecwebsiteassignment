## Project Mirror (2022)

Uses AI computer vision to take a video stream from a camera, a png image of a piece of clothing, and make it look like you were wearing that piece of clothing
Coupled with an AI recommendation engine, it can be used to tinderify clothes shopping. Uses gesture recognition to detect left, right and up swipes.

Tech Stack: Python, OpenCV, TensorFlow, MediaPipe

Made for TOHacks Hackathon

## This Website (2022)

A backend that stores markdown files, renders them as HTML, and allows an admin who is signed in to create, edit, and delete pages by writing plaintext instead of editing HTML.
The Matrix rain effect is a part of the background template.

Tech Stack: Python, Django, HTML, CSS, Javascript

## Advanced gesture recognition system

A Computer vision program that uses Tensorflow, MediaPipe and OpenCV to recognize and classify hand gestures, and control a computer from a distance using that. Was originally made for being able to remotely pause or resume a video while watching on the TV from the couch.
very easy to modify, train and configure for a specific use case.

Tech stack: Python, OpenCV, TensorFlow, MediaPipe, PyAutoGui (to emulate keyboard and mouse)

## Home automation system

A collection of a lot of software and hardware projects, from security systems, automatic window openers, Arduino and RPI systems, webservers, and AI computer vision, speech recognition and NLP as the interface. It will get its own project page soon

Tech stack: everything

more coming soon
