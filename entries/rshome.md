## About the RedSuns

The RedSuns team was established in February 2020, for the UTMC (UTS-TOPS Mathematics Competition), where we got the highest score on one of the rounds.

The name stuck, and we decided to do more contests together as a friend group.

in 2021, all the RedSuns members got into the TOPS program at MGCI, and more people from MGCI joined the team.

The RedSuns (with newly recruited members) participated in the Berkeley Math Tournament in late 2021

in March 2022, the RedSuns (now with members from WLMAC CI as well) participated in the CMIMC programming contest and came first place.

The RedSuns is now affiliated with (Math Et. Al)[https://mathetal.org], a STEM organization, now comprised of members from all over the world, mainly from the Greater Toronto Area.
